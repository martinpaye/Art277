<h2>Re: Albert Momo university application</h2>
<hr>

<p>Dear Mr. Momo,<br><br>

Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University's science faculty to study<br> 
as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>


<h3>Starting dates</h3>
<p>We are happy to accommodate you<!-- This is just an assignment done by a student--> starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit
<br>us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as<br>follow:</p>
<p>First semester: 9 October2022<br>Second semester: 15 January 2023<br>
Third semester: 2 May 2023<br><br>

Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br>
You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>

<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
<p>At the StarzUniversity, we have a pretty open-minded research facility as long as the subjects<br> 
fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated<br> 
researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas<br> you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:<br><br>
Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)<br>
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), 
when the audience size exponentially increase (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>
increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>).</p>
<p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p>

<p>So please can you provide more
information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd<br>expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd<br> need to know? Thanks.<br></p>
<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To<br> 
answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
<p>
<p>Polynesian chicken dance<br>
A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,a whole village<br> 
would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be <q>fruitful</q><br>
Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
 Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling<br> their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.<br> 
Arctic robot dance<br>
An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s<br>believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by <q>robotic</q>, stilted<br> movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on<br> however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really<br> cold.</p>
<p>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.<br><br>

Yours sincerely,<br><br>
Prof. Henry Nana<br><br>
